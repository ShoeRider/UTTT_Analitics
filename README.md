# UTTT_Analitics
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a simple advancement to Tic Tac Toeâ€™s game, except the board is expanded to contain nine miniature tick tack toe games. For a general
idea about the game, check out this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37PC0bGMiTI Note the implemented rules in my program are slightly different and will be added in an additional document/Tutorial.

This repository contains a simple CPP program to find the best strategies/moves based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search. 


Finished:
+ Basic MCTS.
+ Parallel MCTS to decrease search time.
+ Basic MCHS. HashTable and hashes of game states to remove overlapping game branches.

In progress: 
+ Save/Read Book Moves for faster initial searches.
+ Unit Testing Through GTest
+ Machine learning with Neural Networks with backpropagation to help find moves faster 



requirements:

gcc
valgrind
