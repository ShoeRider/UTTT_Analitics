Ultimate Tick Tack Toe is a simple advancement to the game Tick Tack Toe, except the board, is expanded to contain nine smaller tick tack toe games. for a general idea about the game check out this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37PC0bGMiTI
Note the implemented rules in my program are slightly different and will be added in an additional document/Tutorial.

This repository contains a simple C program to find the best strategies/moves based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search. 
Note The current version is undergoing refactoring and doesn't work!!! Code should be working again soon.

In progress: 
+ Implementing HashTable to remove overlapping game branches.
+ Machine learning with Neural Networks with backpropagation to help find moves faster
